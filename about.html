					Michael is a great designer and programmer who is always thinking about the bigger picture. Always thinking about how to plan for and solve unexpected problems is a great skill of his. He has a great head on his shoulders and is a very helpful person. As a programming mentor and teacher Michael is among the best, going with the 'teach a man how to fish' approach.

				<h1>Michaela Taweel</h1>
				<h3>Programmer</h3>

				<p>
					Michaela's part in working on 'Party Mayhem' was to develop the dodgeball minigame. It is a really fun and difficult replication of the real world game. Michaela is a driven developer and is great at problem solving; if there was ever a problem, Michaela would be straight on it trying to solve it. Michaela's work ethic, and team spirit was a driving force in getting 'Party Mayhem' to the point it reached.

				<h1>Ashley Richmond</h1>
				<h3>Programmer</h3>

				<p>
					Achley is also a very driven developer. Her part in developing 'Party Mayhem' was creating the Missile Madness minigame. Missile Madness was a crazy minigame where you have to avoid incoming missiles from all directions and be the last person standing. Ashley showed off not only great programming skill but also some very impressive pixel art capabilities.

				<h1>Brandon Mawson</h1>
				<h3>Programmer</h3>

				<p>
					Brandon was very enthuisiastic about the group project from the beginning, providing a lot of the key concepts that made it into the final game. The minigame he developed for 'Party Mayhem' was an interesting Pacman-like game. Even with lots of work to do at school and connection difficulties, he managed to play his part in making the game work. Brandon is overall a very nice person with a lot of potential in game development.

				<h1>Harry Halliday</h1>
				<h3>Programmer</h3>

				<p>
					Harry is a bit of a quite person at first but once you get to know him he has a lot to provide to a team. Harry developed a track racing game for 'Party Mayhem', with speed boosts and obstacles to make things interesting. This minigame has the potential to provide a ton of couch co-op fun for the whole family. Harry showed great project managmement skills being able to get such a complex minigame complete within the time given.

				<h1>Christopher Larkin</h1>
				<h3>Composer</h3>

				<p>
					Christopher Larkin kindly allowed the use of 2 of his tracks: 'Hornet' and 'Greenpath' in the Umbra trailer animation. He is a lovely person and composes the best orchestral music in recent history. His soundtracks immerse you in the world they help create and provide so much more to an atmosphere than the sum of their parts. Without these provided tracks, the Umbra animation wouldn't even be half of what it became. Christopher Larkin is truly a god of the composing world.
