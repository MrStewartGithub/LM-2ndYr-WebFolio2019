				<h1>Story</h1>
				
				<p>
					You are Umbra, one of the few surviving members of your kind. You find yourself in the mysterious depths of treacherous caverns trying to find a way for your people to carry on, but you aren’t alone…
					<br><br>
					There’s another race of creatures taking the opportunity to claim the caverns for themselves. They are quick and violent, and difficult to deal with alone. But you are all that’s left to protect your people and the place you call home.
				</p>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="Profile">
				
				<h1>Gameplay</h1>
				
				<p>
					As Umbra you will be ascending the dark caverns to find the source of these creatures of light. As you get closer and closer to their home they get stronger and stronger. You will see ruins and remains of fighting, and along the way you may even discover something… mysterious.
				</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="Profile">
				
				<h1>Hidden Secrets</h1>
				
				<p>
					Those with a knack for exploration will have plenty to find in the back corners and hidden walls of the caverns. You’ll just have to wait and see what you can find…
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="Profile">
				
				<h1>Boss Fights</h1>
				
				<p>
					There will be challenging encounters littered throughout the caverns. They will test your skills, prowess, wit and determination in a plethora of ways, requiring you to think carefully about the mechanics and powers in your possession.

				<h1>Animation Synopsis</h1>
				
				<h3>From The Perspective of Umbra</h3>
				
				<p>
					‘They’re all gone’ I say in my head. ‘There’s hardly any of us left and I’m the only one fit enough to get food. I can’t believe this happened… I don’t know how this happened… it was so fast.’ I look down at my family, or rather what’s left of my family.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					‘I need to go looking again. There’s nothing to eat nearby, but I might be able to look up higher in the caverns.’ I know very well that its dangerous, but the current lack of food is more so, especially with the state some of us are in. I walk past the homes of the Tenebri who used to live here, but they’re long since emptied. The magnitude of skulls littered around the town is gut wrenching. I’d love to clean them up and decorate them respectfully, but right now we need food.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I continue ascending into the caverns until I reach the border, the cliff no Tenebri have crossed for centuries, but I must. I'm feeling colder and colder as I carry on. Something feels off. ‘No... it can't be...’ I don't my eyes. ‘A papyroot? I can gather seeds while I’m here and re-sow our farms!’ But the moment of happiness doesn’t last. I see weird glowing creatures off in the distance, and they’re approaching slowly closer.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I run. I don’t dare to look back as I know they’ll be chasing me. I thought the Lucidus were a myth, and even if they weren’t they shouldn't be this close for another 20 years! I see one lunge at me, missing to the side.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					‘I think I’m losing them.’ But I can’t slow down now. ‘Oh no...’ They’re in front of me. I turn around but there are more there. I'm trapped.
				</p>
